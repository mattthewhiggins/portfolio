        <h3 class="">Designing finance tools for humans</h3>
        <p class="">Money is a very emotional object of everyoneâ€™s lives, it can bring joy and sorrow. The customer base of Barclays is roughly 1 in 4 adults in the UK, meaning millions of daily logins from all types of people.</p>
        <p>Everything we do needs to be designed to cater for the masses yet express the brand and meaning of Barclays. Below are some projects that I had led during my time there.</p>

      <h3 class="">A multi-themed design system</h3>
      <p>I led a team of developers and designers to create the design system for Barclays. It is designed for mulitple brands, the concept is to keep the UX the same but the UI flexible using an atomic design approach.</p>
      <p>We created a sketch library, guidance website for designers and developers, a HTML and CSS, React, Angular, iOS and Android library. </p>

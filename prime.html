      <p>Amazon Prime is the #1 subscription service in the world.</p>
      <p>It has more than x2 customers than Netflix in the UK and US.</p>

  <h2>Prime</h2>
  <h5>of the best possible quality; excellent.</h5>

<p>The Prime package doesn't hold itself together as a brand. It feels like a disjointed set of additional apps. It doesn't feel like a family of premium services.</p>
<img class="width-full" src="images/prime.png">

<p>In the digital age the biggest brand asset a company has is the app icon. So that’s where I suggest they start.</p>
<p>By simply using the palette from the logo you can create a suite of app icons to reflect the benefits of the subscription. People will know before having to download it, whether or not it's included with Prime.</p>
<p>Remove any wording from the app icons, simply because on your home screen on your phone or tablet you have the words under the icon and is unnecessary duplication.</p>

  <p>Free and quick delivery is the #1 reason for people getting Prime, the second is Prime Video. But here you see it's ranked #4 video service in the UK and US.</p>
  <p>Globally it’s ranked 5th.</p>

  <h4>Splash screen</h4>
  <p>There are few opportunities to get your brand across, the splash screen can be used subtly to express that.</p>

  <h4>Home screen</h4>
  <p>This is the place to really engage users. It's an entertainment experience so make it entertaining.</p>

  <h4>Content screen</h4>
  <p>The amount of effort gone into making this content means it deserves to be displayed with as much.</p>

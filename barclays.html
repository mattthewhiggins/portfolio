      <p class="loose-margin">To be human-centred you need to be empathetic to the people using your products and services. As a team we weren’t happy with the astronomical amount of inconsistent UX and UI across our platforms. <br>The current process to designing when each designer took on a project was to use one of their sketch files from a previous project and re-using the assets from there. This meant that everyone was working in silo’s and there was no design community to maintain and update our look and feel across digital. <br>
      <p>So to create a consistent experience, what was originally a side desk
        project with myself and one other desifner was to create a design system
        (Barclays Design Language). It’s now a fully dedicated project with an entire
        team focussing on it and is the go to front-end framework used across the entire design,
        product and engineering teams and is completely required to gain sign-off for any new project or any update to an existing one.

      <h6>Design process</h6>
      <p>Creating a design system that is to be used in a very traditional and fast paced company is very complex. It required design thinking and  </p>
      <h6>Toolkit for designers</h6>
      <p>To ensure designers and developers had everything they needed I started our sketch library, it contains symbolised components, layer styles and text styles to ensure consitency. This is now used and contributed to by the entire design team as we want it to be an ever evolving system, meaning the UI stays fresh and we can constantly improve the UX.</p>

      <h6>Code for developers</h6>
      <p>A Sketch library simply isn’t enough for a design system. No-one using your experiences will see that file. So we have to provide code to back-end engineers. I helped build and lead a dedicated team of front-end developers who created a pure HTML and CSS framework with no javascript, which is a pixel perfect replica of the Sketch library.</p>
      <p>Some projects and teams require more than HTML and CSS. So we also provide design language in React and Anulgar.</p>

    <h6>Website for everyone</h6>
      <p>I wanted to ensure that knowledge and thinking of the team was centrally stored and accessible to both internal employees and external agencies. We created a website to showcase the design system, but also provide our design thinking, research, testing and in-depth developer documentation. It also helps raise awareness to product owners and anyone new to the company.</p>

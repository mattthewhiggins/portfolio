      <p class="loose-margin">To be human-centred you need to be empathetic to the people using your products and services. As a team we weren’t happy with the astronomical amount of inconsistent UX and UI across our platforms. <br>The current process to designing when each designer took on a project was to use one of their sketch files from a previous project and re-using the assets from there. This meant that everyone was working in silo’s and there was no design community to maintain and update our look and feel across digital. <br>
So to create a consistent experience, what was originally a side desk project with myself and one other desifner was to create a design system (Barclays Design Language). It’s now a fully dedicated project with an entire team focussing on it and is the go to front-end framework used across the entire design, product and engineering teams and is completely required to gain sign-off for any new project or any update to an existing one.</p>

      <h6>Design process</h6>
      <p>Creating a design system that is to be used in a very traditional and fast paced company is very complex. It required design thinking and  </p>
      <h6>Toolkit for designers</h6>
      <p>To ensure designers and developers had everything they needed I started our sketch library, it contains symbolised components, layer styles and text styles to ensure consitency. This is now used and contributed to by the entire design team as we want it to be an ever evolving system, meaning the UI stays fresh and we can constantly improve the UX.</p>

      <h6>Code for developers</h6>
      <p>A Sketch library simply isn’t enough for a design system. No-one using your experiences will see that file. So we have to provide code to back-end engineers. I helped build and lead a dedicated team of front-end developers who created a pure HTML and CSS framework with no javascript, which is a pixel perfect replica of the Sketch library.</p>
      <p>Some projects and teams require more than HTML and CSS. So we also provide design language in React and Anulgar.</p>

    <h6>Website for everyone</h6>
      <p>I wanted to ensure that knowledge and thinking of the team was centrally stored and accessible to both internal employees and external agencies. We created a website to showcase the design system, but also provide our design thinking, research, testing and in-depth developer documentation. It also helps raise awareness to product owners and anyone new to the company.</p>

      <h6>Barclays Assistance</h6>
      <p>The design team is structured so that small agile teams focus on customer journeys. I lead 3 different customer journey teams, one of which is called Assistance. This customer journey covers any product or service that helps people. I’ve pulled out a selection of projects that I am proud of.</p>

      <h6>Help & FAQs</h6>
      <p>We decided to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning as a way to help answer questions and direct people when in need. I worked alongside our tech provider to design and build the experience. We started with the main use case, which is the app. It felt important to embed this throughout the entire app as well as have it in one area.</p>
      <p>I helped design the UX and UI, but also the design of the conversations. So that they flow from one to the next seamlessly. This required me learning new skills such as writing JSON and understanding how a neural network works.</p>

      <h6>Appointment booking - in progress</h6>
      <p>In this day and age it should be incredibly simple to contact whoever you need to. In some instances this may need organising. Not so long ago there was no way for someone to book an appointment with Barclays to see a member of staff, whether that be in a branch, chat or over the phone.</p>
      <p>I worked alongside our product owner and tech team to design a solution that was consistent. Meaning if you did it through the app, website, over the phone or in branch. The experience was the same.</p>

<div class="content-indented">
  <h2>Digital receipts</h2>
  <p>Why do we receive a piece of paper detailing a purchase, but we can’t see
    that in our banking apps? Why can’t a customer tap on that £82.97 payment made at John Lewis and see that it was a jumper,
      Google mini and chopping board?</p>
</div>

<!-- Problem statement -->
<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Problem statement</h4>
    <p>Isn’t it about time shops stopped printing receipts, the majority of which are impossible to recycle due to them containing the same chemicals used in single-use plastic.</p>

    <p>What happens if you lose that receipt? Can you return an item? How do you prove the purchase?</p>

    <p>Not only is receipting a problem for people, but also for banks. A large number of helpline calls and visits to a branch are for people to query an unrecognised transaction.</p>

<!-- Early concepts -->
<div class="content-indented">
<h4>Early concepts</h4>
<p>During a GV sprint, I wrote down a "How Might We" statement that asked how Barclays can empower people with their purchases.</p>
<p>It stuck in my head throughout the day so during our "Crazy 8" sessions, I drew some quick concepts. After discussing with the team and dot voting, it felt like one to pursue.</p>
<p>I started to create low-fidelty designs on how this could look.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-indented">
  <p>After sharing all of our ideas with the sprint team, I was asked to continue and start to think what extra information would be beneficial to the customer? Could we introduce insights or actions?</p>
</div>

<!-- customer testing -->
<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Customer validation</h4>
  <p>Everything we do must be tested, tested and tested. For this concept, I worked alongside a researcher and we agreed upon 2 methods. The first was a cord sorting exercise, to understand what was most important to the customer.</p>
  <p>We then ran a usability lab test in order to get a more holistic view of the concept.</p>
  <p>With it being a first, I wanted to focus on the discoverability of the feature, was it obvious you can tap on a transaction or is there a nudge needed? I also wanted to see how often this would be used. Would it be the go-to instead of calling up or asking for help?</p>

  <h4>Getting it on the roadmap</h4>
  <p>After a successful GV Sprint, with customer validation of the concept. I helped pitch it to wider stakeholders within Barclays to get it on our roadmap.</p>

<!-- Iterating section -->
<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Iterating</h4>
<p>Once a fully backed project, the project was assigned a Product Owner and I was asked to lead the design and partner up with another colleague to do pair designing. We began by applying feedback from the customer testing and started to refine the UI to create an MVP for launch.</p>
<p>The project was showcased to the wider digital department and the design team, we typically use design critiques to share early projects, to see if there are any connections with other projects and get general colleague feedback.</p>

<!-- Sign off -->
<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Sign-off</h4>
  <p>Everything at Barclays must have sign off from accessibility, legal and compliance, product and design. I made sure that all of the designs worked across app and web and considered all of our design system best practises.</p>
</div>


<!-- Beta Launch -->
<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Beta launch</h4>
  <p>Before pushing live, We wanted to test the functionality even further, so decided to use Barclays Launchpad, which is a beta app available to ~50,000 Barclays customers.</p>
  <p>It allows them to provide direct feedback and we track feature usage with embedded analytics. We also ran an A/B test for a couple of very small differences to make sure that we had the best design.</p>
</div>

<!-- Beta Launch -->
<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Next?</h4>
  <p>After a succesful beta launch, digital receipts is now available to all Barclays customers. The analytics we're already receving are showing insights into... I've also ran a GV sprint entirely dedicated on the next release to see what else we can do.</p>

  <h2>The objective</h2>
  <p>Reduce phone calls and branch visits by 20% YoY.</p>
  </div>

<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Data analysis and research</h4>
  <p>9% of all phonecalls are customers calling to check that fraud hasn't been commited on their account. These calls are categorised as unrecognised transaction.</p>

</div>
<div class="content-indented">
  <h5>47% of enquiries regarding unrecognised transaction are mistakes and not fraudulent.</h5>

<div class="content-indented">
<h4>So, what is the problem?</h4>
<p class="list-space">The quality of our database for transactional data is very poor. Customers aren't able to understand their payments, resulting in lots of call centre and branch staff time.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-indented">

  <h6>What do we want to see?</h6>
  <p class="list-space">Having clearer transactional data leads to fewer concerns around fraud therefore reducing the amount of people contacting Barclays for help.</p>

  <h6>What‚Äôs the customer benefit?</h6>
  <p class="list-space">Easy to understand and feel confident when viewing your transactions.</p>

  <h6>What do we measure?</h6>
  <p class="list-space">Fewer calls tagged with 'unrecognised transaction.'' NPS to rise because of clearer data less app store reviews about bad transactional data.</p>
</div>





<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>That's great, but let's take this further.</h4>
  <p>My thinking was to organise and facilitate a GV Design Sprint, a tried and tested method in solving complex problems, quickly.</p>
</div>

<img class="hero" src="images/book.png" alt="">

<div class="content-indented">
  <p>I created a "How Might We" as the overarching challenge for the sprint.</p>
</div>

  <div class="content-indented">
    <h4 class="blue">"How might we make transactions clearer to customers, give them better control of purchases and innovate in this space."</h4>

<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>üöÄ Sprint concept - digital receipts</h4>
  <p>Why can‚Äôt a customer tap on the ¬£82.97 payment made at John Lewis and see that it was a jumper, Google mini and chopping board? Why in this age do I get a piece of paper but there's no digital equivalent within my banking app?</p>
  <p>We could start by partnering with our corporate clients like John Lewis and it would be a win for them, Barclays and the customer.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-indented">
  <p>I then quickly brought the concept to life so that we could put it into customer testing.</p>
  <p></p>


</div>
<!-- original concepts -->
<img class="hero" src="images/first-draft.png" alt="">






<!-- customer testing -->
<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Customer validation</h4>
  <p>We first conducted guerrilla research within our branches with customers to see if the concept worked.</p>
  <p>Once confirmed, we conducted a series of usability tests to ensure that the experience itself worked, and iterated after coming across major findings.</p>
</div>

<!-- Problem statement -->
<div class="indented">
  <h4 class="logo-group">Getting buy-in</h4>
  <p class="list-space">With this needing quite a large engineering effort, the product owner and I sat down together to create a business case.</p>
  <h6>‚ôªÔ∏è Save the planet</h6>
  <p class="list-space">Saves businesses money having to print receipts, the majority of which are impossible to recycle due to them containing the same chemicals used in single-use plastic.</p>

  <h6>üíµ Commercial opportunities</h6>
  <p class="list-space">If Barclays can see detailed transactional data, we can possibly profit from it. If it's a flight to Spain, why not surface live foreign currency rates, or use it as a timely reminder to get travel insurance</p>


  <h6>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Proof of purchase</h6>
  <p class="list-space">If you lose a receipt, most places won't allow you to return your product. Some will if bought online, but many don't as there is no proof of purchase. This would help banks with the thousands of credit disputes they receive yearly.</p>

  <h6>ü•µ Difficult for businesses </h6>
  <p class="list-space">It's a great feature for Barclays' business customers. Many business owners rely on receipts as part of their end of year taxes. They are required by law to keep them for a number of years, resulting in taking up office space and being overwhelming to manage.</p>

  <h4>Designing & Iterating</h4>
<!-- <p>Once a fully backed project, myself and the product owner began by engaging engineering and created a release roadmap including an MVP for beta launch.</p> -->
<!-- <p>The project was showcased to the wider digital department and the design team, we typically use design critiques to share early projects, to see if there are any connections with other projects and get general colleague feedback.</p> -->
</div>


<div class="content-indented">
  <h6>MVP Release</h6>
  <p>First iteration was to clean up the data and to provide logos next to each transaction. We found through user testing customers found it better to scan logos than read lines of text. If for any reason there still was an issue with the name of where the payment was sent, the logo helped.</p>
</div>
<!-- iterating designs -->

<div class="content-indented">
  <h6>Release 2</h6>
<p>Our second iteration was to make the transaction list items tappable, then having a page with information of the payment. We also worked with the notifications team to make it clear the transaction was tappable.</p>
</div>
<img class="hero" src="images/release-1.png" alt="">



<!-- Beta Launch -->
<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Beta testing for receipts</h4>
  <p>Before pushing live, We wanted to test the usability of the receipts page, so decided to use Barclays Launchpad, which is a beta app available to ~50,000 Barclays customers.</p>
  <p>It allows them to provide direct feedback and we track feature usage with embedded analytics. We also ran an A/B test for a couple of very small differences to make sure that we had the best design.</p>
</div>
<img class="hero" src="images/iterate.png" alt="">

<img class="hero" src="images/discovery.png" alt="">




<div class="content-indented">
  <h4>Public release</h4>
  <p>Looking at the analytics from the beta release, engagement was okay but not as high as we wanted. So to help our 8 million customers discover the feature.</p>
  <p>I created a design pattern for the rest of the design team to use for any new features being released, the pattern utilises the feature on instagram using stories to explain the product. This makes the feature seem more engaging than a one-pager, it also means the customer doesnt have to tap to proceed.</p>

<div class="content-indented">
  <h6>Next release</h6>
  <p>Our next release brings receipts one tap closer, uses images for products and allows customers to re-purchase something straight within the Barclays app.</p>

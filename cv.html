      <h5 class="grey">Design Lead, Sep 2015 – Present</h5>
      <p>Currently, I am a Design Lead at Barclays. Working on a programme called Platforms. The team and I ideate and release new products and services that allow Barclays to run like a Platform. Each product and service looks to disrupt and improve the experience for our customer base of individuals, small businesses and big corporations.</p>
      <p>Previous to that role, I was the Senior Designer for Barclays’ design system. My aim was to bring together a design community within the Barclays Group and to design and build a beautiful design system for iOS, Android and web across all of our brands.</p>
    <p>I’m also proud that a self-initiated project that allows people to withdraw cash using their phone was

    <h5 class="grey">Designer, Nov 2010 – Sep 2015</h5>
    <p>During my time at Deltatre I was fortunate enough to work with many
        great clients. Looking back the projects that stood out to me were being the digital partner for Channel 4's debut coverage of the 2012
        Paralympic Games, which won our team of 4 a <a class="link" href="http://awards.bafta.org/award/2013/tvcraft/digital-creativity" target="_blank">BAFTA for Digital Creativity.</a></p>
        </p>

    <p>I worked alongside the in-house Olympic design team at BBC Sport to design a
        new video player that integrated live data. That year also marked the BBC's 90th anniversary and they featured it as their latest innovation
        <a class="link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/bbc-innovation.html" target="_blank">at the end of this video.</a></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>I was part of the team who did the complete redesign of <a class="link" href="https://www.fifa.com/" target="_blank">FIFA.com</a>, both visually and structurally.
        Making it responsive for the first time with live data, a shop and in 6
        languages. All in time for the World Cup in 2014. It has stood the test of time as they're still using the same design we did over 5 years ago.</p>

      <h5 class="grey">Design Lead, Sep 2015 – Present</h5>
<p>I currently lead a team of designers and researchers to completely re-think how Barclays operates.
  Specifically looking at how we can become a platform business. The programme was setup to act and
  behave like a design-thinking start-up / ventures programme.
</p>
<p>We work very closely with the product and engineering teams
to ideate and build new products and services to connect
Barclays' huge network of retail customers (individuals like you and me) and it’s business and corporate customers.</p>

    <p> Before that, I was the design lead and team principal for Barclays design language, which is a design
        system created for native app and responsive web. It allows
        Barclays to build anything digital at a pace never seen before at the bank.
        With 3 major brands within the group, we designed and built the
        system with the concept of the UX is consistant, but the UI is flexible.
    </p>


    <p> Before that, I worked on a programme called CX Transformation which looked at stripping our digital offering back to
        its skeleton and building a concept bank. Doing the simple things very
        well and adding innovation. I had the pleasure of presenting it to our CEO as our strategy to
        compete with new fintech companies looking to capitalise on the Open
        Banking initiative.
    </p>



    <p>I've also enjoyed working on Barclays Launchpad which is a beta app that
        allows the design team to quickly get customer feedback on new ideas.
        One of my ideas was

    <h5 class="grey">Designer, Nov 2010 – Sep 2015</h5>
    <p>During my time at Deltatre I was fortunate enough to work with many
        great clients. Looking back the projects that stood out to me were being the digital partner for Channel 4's debut coverage of the 2012
        Paralympic Games, which won our team of 4 a <a class="link" href="http://awards.bafta.org/award/2013/tvcraft/digital-creativity" target="_blank">BAFTA for Digital Creativity.</a></p>
        </p>

    <p>I worked alongside the in-house Olympic team at BBC Sport to design a
        new video player that integrated live data. That year also marked the BBC's 90th anniversary and they featured it as their latest innovation
        <a class="link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/bbc-innovation.html" target="_blank">at the end of this video.</a></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>I was part of the team who did the complete redesign of <a class="link" href="https://www.fifa.com/" target="_blank">FIFA.com</a>, both visually and structurally.
        Making it responsive for the first time with live data, a shop and in 6
        languages. All in time for the World Cup in 2014. It has stood the test of time as they're still using the same design we did over 5 years ago.</p>

      <h5 class="grey">Design Principle, Sep 2015 – Present</h5>
<p>I'm currently a Design Principle at Barclays, leading a team of 9 designers. Our current project is focussing on ideating and designing new products
  and services for Barclays, with the idea of pivoting the bank to a platform business model.</p>
  <p>The concept is to look at the interactions of our current customer base of individuals, small businesses and big corporations. They already interact with one another, how can Barclays join the dots between their interactions.</p>
<p>As a team we are constantly sprinting and delivering new products and services working very closely with the product and engineering teams in an Agile ways of working.</p>

    <p> Before that, I was the design lead and team principal for Barclays design language, which is a design
        system created for native app and responsive web. It allows
        Barclays to build anything digital at a pace never seen before at the bank.
        With 3 major brands within the group, we designed and built the
        system with the concept of the UX is consistant, but the UI is flexible.
    </p>


    <p> Before that, I worked on a programme called CX Transformation which looked at stripping our digital offering back to
        its skeleton and building a concept bank. Doing the simple things very
        well and adding innovation. I had the pleasure of presenting it to our CEO as our strategy to
        compete with all the new fintech companies popping up.
    </p>



    <p>I've also enjoyed working on Barclays Launchpad which is a beta app that
        allows the design team to quickly gain customer feedback on ideas.
        One of my ideas that was given the green-light was

    <h5 class="grey">Designer, Nov 2010 – Sep 2015</h5>
    <p>During my time at Deltatre I was fortunate enough to work with many
        great clients. Looking back the projects that stood out to me were being the digital partner for Channel 4's debut coverage of the 2012
        Paralympic Games, which won our team of 4 a <a class="link" href="http://awards.bafta.org/award/2013/tvcraft/digital-creativity" target="_blank">BAFTA for Digital Creativity.</a></p>
        </p>

    <p>I worked alongside the in-house Olympic design team at BBC Sport to design a
        new video player that integrated live data. That year also marked the BBC's 90th anniversary and they featured it as their latest innovation
        <a class="link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/bbc-innovation.html" target="_blank">at the end of this video.</a></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>I was part of the team who did the complete redesign of <a class="link" href="https://www.fifa.com/" target="_blank">FIFA.com</a>, both visually and structurally.
        Making it responsive for the first time with live data, a shop and in 6
        languages. All in time for the World Cup in 2014. It has stood the test of time as they're still using the same design we did over 5 years ago.</p>

      <h4>Design Lead – Barclays <br>(Sep 2015 – Present)</h4>
      <p>During my time working at Barclays there are 3 projects that I am mostly
          proud of.
      </p>


    <p>CX Transformation which looked at stripping our digital offering back to
        its skeleton and building a concept bank. Doing the simple things very
        well and adding innovation. It was pitched to our CEO as our strategy to
        compete with new fintech companies looking to capitalise once once open
        banking happens.
    </p>


    <p>Design lead and principal for Barclays design language which is a UI
        library designed and built for native app and responsive web. It allows
        Barclays to build anything digital at a pace never seen before at the bank.
        Barclays has 3 major brands within the group and we designed and built the
        library to have themable components, meaning for example a button is only
        needed to be built once, only the theme changes.
    </p>


    <p>Finally Platforms, which was completely looking at changing how Barclays
      can pivot into a platform business. By Ideating and building products and
      services that connects the already existing huge network of individuals,
      SME'S and Coproate customers.
    </p>


    <p>I've also enjoyed working on Barclays Launchpad which is a beta app that
        allows the design team to quickly get customer feedback on new ideas.
        One of my ideas that went on to being released was
        <a class="green-link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38054298">featured on BBC News - Technology﻿</a>
    </p>

    <h4>Designer – Deltatre<br>(Nov 2010 – Sep 2015)</h4>
    <p>During my time at Deltatre I was fortunate enough to work with many
        great clients. Looking back the projects that stood out to me were being the digital partner for Channel 4's debut coverage of the 2012
        Paralympic Games, which won our team of 4 creatives a <a class="green-link" href="http://awards.bafta.org/award/2013/tvcraft/digital-creativity">BAFTA for Digital Creativity.</a></p>
        </p>

    <p>I worked alongside the in-house Olympic team at BBC Sport to design a
        new video player that integrated live data. The BBC wanted to celebrate 90 years of innovation, it was featured as their latest
        <a class="green-link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/bbc-innovation.html">the end of this video.</a></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>The complete redesign of <a class="green-link" href="https://www.fifa.com/">FIFA.com</a>, both visually and structurally.
        Making it responsive for the first time with live data, a shop, in 6
        languages. All in time for the World Cup in 2014.</p>
